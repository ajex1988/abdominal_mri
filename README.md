# Duke Abdominal MRI Series Dataset
This dataset contains abdominal MRI series for 190 patients, including 134 males and 56 females. There are 190 exams (3717 series) in total. Each series was annotated by two radiologists in consensus with regard to series type. We have annotated 30 series types (details below). This dataset was collected at Duke University Medical Center.
